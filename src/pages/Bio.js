                <p>My name is Brian, and I am a fullstack development student in the UCSD extension program. </p>
                
                <p><b>I love to solve problems.</b> Whether it's rebuilding engines or making sure a customer leaves
                    happy, I enjoy handling challenges and exploring new methods for solving them. This, and the
                    creativity coding brings are the reasons that have drawn me to the field of web development. My
                    passion for exploring has lead me to a colorful background of experience, from a Bachelors in
                    Psychology to my summers farming oysters in the Pacific Northwest. My exceptional and varied pallet
                    of knowledge provides me the tools to solve problems outside my breadth of expertise, and makes me a
                    valuable member of any team.</p>
